AgoraD-MarketplaceUI
====================
Another django project which will have closed signups. An organization that wishes to create a data sharing marketplace (like us) will host the project on their servers and fascilitate the transfer of data. In order to join the exchange, you would contact the marketplace manager and be let in. You would then be able to browse the data sellers and contact information. Once an agreement is reached, the seller clicks a button to initiate transfer to another user, that user then accepts and the transfer starts. Marketplace tracks these deals.

Current State
-------------
The repository is strictly a bare django install
